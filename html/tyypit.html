          <h2>Tyypit</h2>
          <p>
            Kitarat jaetaan usein kahteen pääluokkaan: akustisiin ja
            sähkökitaroihin. Kummassakin luokassa on edelleen alaluokkia, joita
            on lähes loputtomasti ja jotka kehittyvät jatkuvasti. Esimerkiksi
            sähkökitara voidaan ostaa kuusikielisenä mallina (yleisin malli) tai
            seitsen- tai kaksitoistakielisenä versiona. Instrumentin yleinen
            muotoilu, sisäinen rakenne ja komponentit, puulaji tai -lajit,
            metalliosat ja elektroniset ominaisuudet kaikki lisäävät alaluokkien
            runsauden luonnetta ja sen ainutlaatuisia tonaalisia ja
            toiminnallisia ominaisuuksia.
          </p>
          <h3>Acoustic</h3>
          <p>
            Acoustic guitars form several notable subcategories within the
            acoustic guitar group: classical and flamenco guitars; steel-string
            guitars, which include the flat-topped, or "folk", guitar;
            twelve-string guitars; and the arched-top guitar. The acoustic
            guitar group also includes unamplified guitars designed to play in
            different registers, such as the acoustic bass guitar, which has a
            similar tuning to that of the electric bass guitar.
          </p>
          <h3>Renaissance and Baroque</h3>
          <p>
            Renaissance and Baroque guitars are the ancestors of the modern
            classical and flamenco guitar. They are substantially smaller, more
            delicate in construction, and generate less volume. The strings are
            paired in courses as in a modern 12-string guitar, but they only
            have four or five courses of strings rather than six single strings
            normally used now. They were more often used as rhythm instruments
            in ensembles than as solo instruments, and can often be seen in that
            role in early music performances. (Gaspar Sanz's Instrucción de
            Música sobre la Guitarra Española of 1674 contains his whole output
            for the solo guitar.)[20] Renaissance and Baroque guitars are easily
            distinguished, because the Renaissance guitar is very plain and the
            Baroque guitar is very ornate, with ivory or wood inlays all over
            the neck and body, and a paper-cutout inverted "wedding cake" inside
            the hole.
          </p>
          <h3>Classical</h3>
          <p>
            Classical guitars, also known as "Spanish" guitars,[21] are
            typically strung with nylon strings, plucked with the fingers,
            played in a seated position and are used to play a diversity of
            musical styles including classical music. The classical guitar's
            wide, flat neck allows the musician to play scales, arpeggios, and
            certain chord forms more easily and with less adjacent string
            interference than on other styles of guitar. Flamenco guitars are
            very similar in construction, but they are associated with a more
            percussive tone. In Portugal, the same instrument is often used with
            steel strings particularly in its role within fado music. The guitar
            is called viola, or violão in Brazil, where it is often used with an
            extra seventh string by choro musicians to provide extra bass
            support.

          <p>
            In Mexico, the popular mariachi band includes a range of guitars,
            from the small requinto to the guitarrón, a guitar larger than a
            cello, which is tuned in the bass register. In Colombia, the
            traditional quartet includes a range of instruments too, from the
            small bandola (sometimes known as the Deleuze-Guattari, for use when
            traveling or in confined rooms or spaces), to the slightly larger
            tiple, to the full-sized classical guitar. The requinto also appears
            in other Latin-American countries as a complementary member of the
            guitar family, with its smaller size and scale, permitting more
            projection for the playing of single-lined melodies. Modern
            dimensions of the classical instrument were established by the
            Spaniard Antonio de Torres Jurado (1817–1892).[22]
          </p>
          <h3>Flat-top</h3>
          <p>
            Flat-top guitars with steel strings are similar to the classical
            guitar, however, the flat-top body size is usually significantly
            larger than a classical guitar, and has a narrower, reinforced neck
            and stronger structural design. The robust X-bracing typical of
            flat-top guitars was developed in the 1840s by German-American
            luthiers, of whom Christian Friedrich "C. F." Martin is the best
            known. Originally used on gut-strung instruments, the strength of
            the system allowed the later guitars to withstand the additional
            tension of steel strings. Steel strings produce a brighter tone and
            a louder sound. The acoustic guitar is used in many kinds of music
            including folk, country, bluegrass, pop, jazz, and blues. Many
            variations are possible from the roughly classical-sized OO and
            Parlour to the large Dreadnought (the most commonly available type)
            and Jumbo. Ovation makes a modern variation, with a rounded
            back/side assembly molded from artificial materials.
          </p>
          <h3>Archtop</h3>
          <p>
            Archtop guitars are steel-string instruments in which the top (and
            often the back) of the instrument are carved from a solid billet,
            into a curved, rather than flat, shape. This violin-like
            construction is usually credited to the American Orville Gibson.
            Lloyd Loar of the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co introduced the
            violin-inspired F-shaped hole design now usually associated with
            archtop guitars, after designing a style of mandolin of the same
            type. The typical archtop guitar has a large, deep, hollow body
            whose form is much like that of a mandolin or a violin-family
            instrument. Nowadays, most archtops are equipped with magnetic
            pickups, and they are therefore both acoustic and electric. F-hole
            archtop guitars were immediately adopted, upon their release, by
            both jazz and country musicians, and have remained particularly
            popular in jazz music, usually with flatwound strings.
          </p>
          <h3>Resonator, resophonic or Dobros</h3>
          <p>
            All three principal types of resonator guitars were invented by the
            Slovak-American John Dopyera (1893–1988) for the National and Dobro
            (Dopyera Brothers) companies. Similar to the flat top guitar in
            appearance, but with a body that may be made of brass,
            nickel-silver, or steel as well as wood, the sound of the resonator
            guitar is produced by one or more aluminum resonator cones mounted
            in the middle of the top. The physical principle of the guitar is
            therefore similar to the loudspeaker.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original purpose of the resonator was to produce a very loud
            sound; this purpose has been largely superseded by electrical
            amplification, but the resonator guitar is still played because of
            its distinctive tone. Resonator guitars may have either one or three
            resonator cones. The method of transmitting sound resonance to the
            cone is either a "biscuit" bridge, made of a small piece of hardwood
            at the vertex of the cone (Nationals), or a "spider" bridge, made of
            metal and mounted around the rim of the (inverted) cone (Dobros).
            Three-cone resonators always use a specialized metal bridge. The
            type of resonator guitar with a neck with a square
            cross-section—called "square neck" or "Hawaiian"—is usually played
            face up, on the lap of the seated player, and often with a metal or
            glass slide. The round neck resonator guitars are normally played in
            the same fashion as other guitars, although slides are also often
            used, especially in blues.
          </p>
          <h3>Steel guitar</h3>
          <p>
            A steel guitar is any guitar played while moving a polished steel
            bar or similar hard object against plucked strings. The bar itself
            is called a "steel" and is the source of the name "steel guitar".
            The instrument differs from a conventional guitar in that it does
            not use frets; conceptually, it is somewhat akin to playing a guitar
            with one finger (the bar). Known for its portamento capabilities,
            gliding smoothly over every pitch between notes, the instrument can
            produce a sinuous crying sound and deep vibrato emulating the human
            singing voice. Typically, the strings are plucked (not strummed) by
            the fingers of the dominant hand, while the steel tone bar is
            pressed lightly against the strings and moved by the opposite hand.
            The instrument is played while sitting, placed horizontally across
            the player's knees or otherwise supported. The horizontal playing
            style is called "Hawaiian style".[23]
          </p>
          <h3>Twelve-string</h3>
          <p>
            The twelve-string guitar usually has steel strings, and it is widely
            used in folk music, blues, and rock and roll. Rather than having
            only six strings, the 12-string guitar has six courses made up of
            two strings each, like a mandolin or lute. The highest two courses
            are tuned in unison, while the others are tuned in octaves. The
            12-string guitar is also made in electric forms. The chime-like
            sound of the 12-string electric guitar was the basis of jangle pop.
          </p>
          <h3>Acoustic bass</h3>
          <p>
            The acoustic bass guitar is a bass instrument with a hollow wooden
            body similar to, though usually somewhat larger than, that of a
            six-string acoustic guitar. Like the traditional electric bass
            guitar and the double bass, the acoustic bass guitar commonly has
            four strings, which are normally tuned E-A-D-G, an octave below the
            lowest four strings of the six-string guitar, which is the same
            tuning pitch as an electric bass guitar. It can, more rarely, be
            found with five or six strings, which provides a wider range of
            notes to be played with less movement up and down the neck.
          </p>
          <h3>Electric</h3>
          <p>
            Electric guitars can have solid, semi-hollow, or hollow bodies;
            solid bodies produce little sound without amplification. In contrast
            to a standard acoustic guitar, electric guitars instead rely on
            electromagnetic pickups, and sometimes piezoelectric pickups, that
            convert the vibration of the steel strings into signals, which are
            fed to an amplifier through a patch cable or radio transmitter. The
            sound is frequently modified by other electronic devices (effects
            units) or the natural distortion of valves (vacuum tubes) or the
            pre-amp in the amplifier. There are two main types of magnetic
            pickups, single- and double-coil (or humbucker), each of which can
            be passive or active. The electric guitar is used extensively in
            jazz, blues, R & B, and rock and roll. The first successful magnetic
            pickup for a guitar was invented by George Beauchamp, and
            incorporated into the 1931 Ro-Pat-In (later Rickenbacker) "Frying
            Pan" lap steel; other manufacturers, notably Gibson, soon began to
            install pickups in archtop models. After World War II the completely
            solid-body electric was popularized by Gibson in collaboration with
            Les Paul, and independently by Leo Fender of Fender Music. The lower
            fretboard action (the height of the strings from the fingerboard),
            lighter (thinner) strings, and its electrical amplification lend the
            electric guitar to techniques less frequently used on acoustic
            guitars. These include tapping, extensive use of legato through
            pull-offs and hammer-ons (also known as slurs), pinch harmonics,
            volume swells, and use of a tremolo arm or effects pedals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some electric guitar models feature piezoelectric pickups, which
            function as transducers to provide a sound closer to that of an
            acoustic guitar with the flip of a switch or knob, rather than
            switching guitars. Those that combine piezoelectric pickups and
            magnetic pickups are sometimes known as hybrid guitars.[24]
          </p>
          <p>
            Hybrids of acoustic and electric guitars are also common. There are
            also more exotic varieties, such as guitars with two, three,[25] or
            rarely four necks, all manner of alternate string arrangements,
            fretless fingerboards (used almost exclusively on bass guitars,
            meant to emulate the sound of a stand-up bass), 5.1 surround guitar,
            and such.
          </p>
          <h3>Seven-string and eight-string</h3>
          <p>
            Solid-body seven-string guitars were popularized in the 1980s and
            1990s. Other artists go a step further, by using an eight-string
            guitar with two extra low strings. Although the most common
            seven-string has a low B string, Roger McGuinn (of The Byrds and
            Rickenbacker) uses an octave G string paired with the regular G
            string as on a 12-string guitar, allowing him to incorporate chiming
            12-string elements in standard six-string playing. In 1982 Uli Jon
            Roth developed the "Sky Guitar", with a vastly extended number of
            frets, which was the first guitar to venture into the upper
            registers of the violin. Roth's seven-string and "Mighty Wing"
            guitar features a wider octave range.[citation needed]
          </p>
          <h3>Electric bass</h3>
          <p>
            Höfner 500/1 bass guitar that has been recognized by many music fans
            for decades as the bass used by Sir Paul McCartney for almost 60
            years
          </p>
          <p>
            The bass guitar (also called an "electric bass", or simply a "bass")
            is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but
            with a longer neck and scale length, and four to six strings. The
            four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same
            as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one octave lower
            than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G).
            The bass guitar is a transposing instrument, as it is notated in
            bass clef an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to
            avoid excessive ledger lines being required below the staff. Like
            the electric guitar, the bass guitar has pickups and it is plugged
            into an amplifier and speaker for live performances.
